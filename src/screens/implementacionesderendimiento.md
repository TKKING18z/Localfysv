Summary
We've implemented several performance improvements and optimizations for your Localfy app:
Fast Image Caching: Added the FastImageView component using react-native-fast-image for efficient image loading and caching.
Memory Usage Optimization: Created an improved image upload system with automatic compression, local caching, and offline support.
Network-Aware Components: Added a NetworkContext and OfflineBanner to handle poor network conditions gracefully.
Component Optimization: Applied memoization and performance best practices to prevent unnecessary re-renders in ChatMessage, ChatHeader, and other components.
App Initialization Service: Created a performance-focused app initialization flow that prioritizes getting the app ready for user interaction.
Performance Utilities: Added debounce and throttle utilities to prevent excessive function calls.
Hermes Engine Recommendation: Added instructions to enable Hermes for better JavaScript performance.
These changes will help with:
Faster app startup
Reduced memory usage
Better handling of poor network connections
More responsive UI
Handling image uploads even when offline
Preventing app crashes in chat and profile screens
Most crashes in the conversation and profile screens likely came from memory issues or unhandled errors during image loading. The optimization of FastImage and better error handling should resolve these issues.
To continue optimizing your app, you should:
Monitor memory usage with tools like Flipper or React Native Debugger
Implement virtualized lists (FlatList) with proper optimizations for any long lists
Consider adding error boundaries around critical components to prevent crashes
Use the React DevTools Profiler to identify components that re-render too often
